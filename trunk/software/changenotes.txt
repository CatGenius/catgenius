B05:
	RD	serial.c	- Implemented ISR for TX/RX
					- Implemented XON/XOFF flow control
					- Added HAS_COMMANDLINE and HAS_BLUETOOTH
	CM	CatGenius	- *** NOTE: GenieDiag, other CG tools, and 877A support is BROKEN ***
					- Created bluetooth.c/.h
					- Added common/app_prefs.h to support application-
					  specific preferences. For example, for CatGenius, this
					  redirects to catgenius/catgenius_prefs.h.  Each app will
					  need to have it's own define like APP_CATGENIUS set in
					  the .mcp file
					- Added prot_src.h and prot_inc.h for easier var/fn sharing				
					- Added types.h with standard types like uint16_t and shorthand types like _U16					  
					- Added "flow" argument for serial_init
					- Added serial lineterm config (CR, LF, or CRLF)
					- Prefixed all command-line service routines with "cmd_"
					- Added the following additional command line functions:
					  - rxtest
					  - txtest
					  - mode
					  - setup (diff than diag)
					  - start (diff than diag)
					  - lock (from diag)
					- Added the following to the project, and set up
					  conditionals for each:
					  cr14
					  i2c
					  cmdline_box
					  cmdline_gpio
					  cmdline_tag			
					- Added new macro TX/TX2 to do nothing if HAS_SERIAL is not
					  defined; Changed all printf references to this instead
					- Replaced DBG macro with DBG/DBG2 to do nothing if
					  HAS_SERIAL and HAS_DEBUG are not defined; Changed code
					  to use DBG2
					- Memory optimization
					- Added command line support for DEL in addition to BKSP
					- Command line now erases previous char from screen on DEL/BKSP
					
TBD:
	- Should move all box information OUT of userinterface
	- Integrate GenieDiag UI code into CatGenius
