= How does it work? =

CartridgeGenius is a drop-in replacement for the cartridge tag reader in your catbox. It simulates the presence of the both the original tag reader and the tag on the cartridge. We call this simulated cartridge a virtual cartridge. This enables you to repair your catbox in case the original tag reader broke down, or to remain using your box in case the supplier goes out of business, as was the case with the LitterFree box. In other words: CartridgeGenius puts you back in control over your appliance.

= Features =

CartridgeGenius does a little more than just simulating a cartridge. It extends your possibilities and allow you to use wash your box as often as you want, without paying the penalty. Below is a list of it's features:
  * Simulates the presence and absence of a cartridge. With one press of a button, the virtual cartridge can be inserted or removed from the litter box.
  * Simulated user adjustable virtual cartridge level. With another button the level of the virtual cartridge can be changed.
  * Simulates different cartridge types. Whether you want 120 cycle cartridge, a 60 cycle cartridge or even a maintenance cartridge, you can select it at the touch of a button.
  * Auto-mode does it all, automatically. When enabled, you'll never need to think about the virtual cartridge again: As soon as the virtual cartridge level hits 0, the virtual cartridge is removed, reset to 100% and re-inserted automatically. This is very useful for people who prefer to use a large external reservoir instead of cartridges.
