= Introduction =

Then CartridgeGenius may be just what you are looking for: CartridgeGenius is a cartridge emulator that puts you back in control over your litter box by making it think it has a full cartridge. The Genie is finally out of the bottle!<br>

= How does it work? =

CartridgeGenius is a drop-in replacement for the cartridge tag reader in your litter box. It simulates the presence of the both the original tag reader and the tag on the cartridge. I call this simulated cartridge a virtual cartridge. This enables you to repair your litter box in case the original tag reader broke down, or to remain using your box in case the supplier goes out of business, as was the case with the LitterFree box. In other words: CartridgeGenius puts you back in control over your appliance.

= Features =

CartridgeGenius does a little more than just simulating a cartridge. It extends your possibilities and allow you to use wash your box as often as you want, without paying the penalty. Below is a list of it's features:
  * Simulates the presence and absence of a cartridge. With one press of a button, the virtual cartridge can be inserted or removed from the litter box.
  * Simulated user adjustable virtual cartridge level. With another button the level of the virtual cartridge can be changed.
  * Simulates different cartridge types. Whether you want 120 cycle cartridge, a 60 cycle cartridge or even a maintenance cartridge, you can select it at the touch of a button.
  * Auto-mode does it all, automatically. When enabled, you'll never need to think about the virtual cartridge again: As soon as the virtual cartridge level hits 0, the virtual cartridge is removed, reset to 100% and re-inserted automatically. This is very useful for people who prefer to use a large external reservoir instead of cartridges.
It's easy; Anybody can do it. You don't need to be a genius to use CartridgeGenius, just watch this demonstration video:<br>

= Before you order =

== Responsibility ==

Installing this component involves opening the processing unit of your litter box. It directly connects to the internal low-voltage electronic circuits of your box. In a very far-fetched short circuit situation it is theoretically possible that the exposed conductors on the CartridgeGenius will carry live mains voltage. Since I have no influence on how well or careful CartridgeGenius is installed, I will take no responsibility whatsoever for any resulting damage of installing CartridgeGenius. In other words: Installing CartridgeGenius and any resulting damage by installing or using it is completely at your own risk. By buying this component you agree to that.

== Compatibility ==

CartridgeGenius works on Model 120 and Model 120+ CatGenie litter boxes. It is also compatible with VIC Club (Very Important Cats Club) boxes, but only after you have fulfilled your VIC 1080 or VIC 840 supply contract. CartridgeGenius is NOT compatible with the older Model 60.

== Warranty ==

That's simple: This hand assembled device comes with a ONE YEAR warranty. This is reduced from the warranty for the first generation units. If it's defective, unable to do what it's supposed to do, and it's not caused by mis-handling, We will repair it or replace it for free. However, you do have to pay for shipment back and forth. Having said that, CartridgeGenius will most likely outlive the mechanics of your box by far.

I have to make one exception for warranty: We cannot guarantee this CartridgeGenius to work with future litter boxes, due to possible counter measures. Therefore CartridgeGenius not working on a newly replaced litter box is not covered.

If you have just purchased CartridgeGenius and it doesn't work with your current box, we will help you getting it to work. If we can't, we will offer you to send it back for a refund for the purchasing price (not including shipment).

== Generic tips ==

If you own a compatible litter box and you're considering to buy a CartridgeGenius, then please do so now because the device may no longer be available in the future. The devices have in stock are the only devices left and I don't think I will build another batch.

Do NOT buy a CartridgeGenius if you consider to buy a litter box in the future. CartridgeGenius works with litter boxes currently on the market, but nobody knows if it will work with future versions and revisions.

Don't wait until your cartridge is depleted before ordering or installing CartridgeGenius. Keep a working original cartridge at hand because it's a very useful tool when diagnosing problems. If you have a problem, my first question will be: Does the problem occur when using the original cartridge reader with an original cartridge?
