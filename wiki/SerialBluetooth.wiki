#summary Adding Serial Bluetooth

= Introduction =

My cats _love_ chewing on USB cables, serial cables, power cables... basically any kind of cable.  If your cats are anything like mine, you'll want a wireless serial connection to your CatGenius.  This page tells you how to do so for under USD $50.

Here is the end goal:<br>

= Why Bluetooth? =

No wires, as stated above.  Also, the goal here is to provide something that's inexpensive and easy to set up.  "Plug-and-play", if you will.

An obvious alternative is WiFi, but at the time this page was written an affordable module that wouldn't require significant modifications and involved PCB/soldering work could not be found.

Another alternative is WiFi-based Serial and/or USB devices, but these are more expensive than the Bluetooth module usually and typically require special connectors, level shifters, etc.

Plus, you can connect to Bluetooth with almost anything.  A laptop is convenient, but a smart phone is even more convenient.  Android has a number of Bluetooth serial apps that work well.  iOS does as well.

= Preparation =

Materials:
  * [#Bluetooth_Module Bluetooth module]
  * At least one break-away male header: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116
  * [#Connector_Cable Connector cable]
  * Soldering iron
  * Solder
  * Desoldering wick (Optional)

Procedure:
  * Review the page about adding a [HowToAddSerialPort Serial Port].  Do not follow the instructions, just take note of the information documented there
  * Install a header on the Bluetooth module
  * Install a serial header on CatGenie board
  * Create the cable to connect them
  * Connect the Bluetooth module to the CG board using the cable
  * Mount the Bluetooth module to the inside of the CG shell using tape or some other mounting mechanism

= Bluetooth module =

We'll be using the Roving Networks Bluetooth Mate Silver (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10393) for several reasons:
    * It is affordable (USD $40)
    * No other parts required other than a connector cable
    * No need for external power: It will run off the +5V CG serial connection just fine thanks to a built-in power regulator and a good range of voltage tolerance
    * It supports a wide range of TTL signalling levels, avoiding the need for a level-shifter 
    * It can be re-used with almost any device if you'd like to reappropriate it later (Arduino, etc.)

The module comes without a header.  Solder one on like so:<br>

= CatGenie Board Serial Header =

The CG board comes without a serial header, so unless you've already done so, you'll need to solder one in now.  It's a pretty tight fit in there.  If you're not very good at soldering like me, and in order to avoid having to pull the whole board out, pull 4 pins out of a header and solder each individually while holding with a pair of pliers like so:<br>

= Connector Cable =

We'll need a connector/jumper cable to connect the Bluetooth module to the serial header on the CG board.

You can make your own cable using left-over PC ribbon cable or equivalent, or mod a pre-made one.  For those of us sloppy with a soldering iron, the pre-made route is suggested.  Purchase one 6-pin (Bluetooth module) and one 4-pin (CG board) cable in order to accommodate both ends:<br>
6-pin: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10366<br>
4-pin: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10364<br>

For convenience, use the 4-pin cable as-is on one side, and remove the pins from the other side.  Removed the header from the 6-pin cable completely, and insert the removed pins from the 4-pin cable into it.  There more information about how to remove pins on the [HowToProgram#Using_A_Pre-Made_Cable firmware programming page].

The finished cable should look like below.  The 6-pin side is lined up the way it should be connected to the Bluetooth module:<br>

This is how it should be connected to the CatGenie serial header.  Note that the red wire connects to the 5V pin and green goes to GND:<br>

To avoid the extra cost of two cables, you could just use a single 6-pin cable.  If you choose to do so, the finished cable should look like below.  Note that in this verison of the cable, the black wire should connect to the GND pin on both the Bluetooth module and the CG board and the green wire should connect to VCC/5V:<br>

= Modifying CatGenius Code =

The standard CatGenius code sets up the serial port for 19200 bps, and GenieDiag sets it up for 38400.  The Bluetooth module expects 115200, so we'll need to change that:<br>
http://catgenius.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/apresence/rn_bt_cg_code_mod.png

After the small code modification, build the code and re-flash the CG.

There is information about how to use the MPLab IDE to make the modifications [PICkit3MPLabs here].

= Connecting to Your CatGenius over Bluetooth =

== Preparing ==

  * Smart phones and tablets: There are many Bluetooth apps out there for just about every device.  Search the app store to download something appropriate.
    * Android: "Bluetooth SPP" is a free app without ads that appears to work well
  * Desktops/laptops: if your computer does not include native Bluetooth support, buy one of the many USB dongles available and install it.
    * Windows: There is some basic information here: http://www.ehow.com/how_7242162_add-bluetooth-serial-ports.html

== Connecting ==

Scan for Bluetooth devices.  The Bluetooth Mate shows up as RN42-XXXX where XXXX is a unique identifier.  Connect to it in SPP/Serial mode, then use any terminal app that supports serial connections to connect to it.

More details will be added later.
